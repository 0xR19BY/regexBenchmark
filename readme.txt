These regular expressions will be tested against the field_file.txt file.

The output from simply running the 'RegexBenchmarking.py' script from powershell.
The output in question will simple be the time it took to run the regex against the field_file.txt, and the number of pattern matches.

Remember to start your regular experession with '^'
